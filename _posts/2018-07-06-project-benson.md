### The Story

My team and I got an email from WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) saying that they will be hosting an annual gala at the beginning of the summer this year. The purpose of the event is to fill the event space with individual passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to increase WTWY's brand awareness. Here's when my team and I come into play. We will utilize the MTA turnstile dataset combined with demographic data and Yelp data to help WTWY decide where to place their flyer distribution team.

### Data

* MTA turnstile data (March - May 2018)
* Yelp data (Restaurants within 3 miles of the Empire State Building)
* 2010 US Census data (5 years projection for 2015)
