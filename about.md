  Hey there!! This is Irene Liu. Gald to see you here. I recently got my MBA degree with a concentration in Data Science and Business Analytics from Santa Clara University. I'm currently improving my data science skill at Metis. Will keep posting my projects I did at SCU and Metis here. Most of the topics of my project will be solving the business problems we've encountered. Some of them will be training the machine learning model. Stay tuned if you are interested.

Thanks for reading!
